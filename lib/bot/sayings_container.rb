    Disturb not the harmony of fire, ice or lightning
    Lest these titans wreck destruction upon the world in which they clash
    Though the water's great guardian shall rise to quell the fighting
    Alone its song will fail, thus the earth shall turn to ash
    Oh, the chosen one
    Into thine hands bring together all three
    The treasures combined tame the beast of the sea
    From the trio of islands ancient spheres shall you take
    For between life and death, all the difference you make
    Oh, the chosen one
    Climb to the shrine to right what is wrong
    And the world will be healed by the guardian's song
    Oh, the chosen one
